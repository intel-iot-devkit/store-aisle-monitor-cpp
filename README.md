![Output snapshot](./docs/images/snap.png)

## What it Does

This reference implementation counts the number of people present in an image and generates a motion heatmap. It takes the input from the camera, or a video file for processing. Snapshots of the output are taken at regular intervals and are uploaded to the cloud. It also stores the snapshots of the output locally.

## Requirements

### Hardware

- 6th to 8th Generation Intel® Core™ processors with Iris® Pro graphics or Intel® HD Graphics

### Software

- [Ubuntu\* 18.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/)<br>
  **Note**: We recommend using a 4.14+ Linux* kernel with this software. Run the following command to determine the kernel version:<br>
     ```
     uname -a
     ```

- Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit 2020 R3 Release

## How it Works
- The application uses a video source, such as a camera or a video file, to grab the frames. The [OpenCV functions](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/videoio/doc/reading_and_writing_video.html) are used to calculate frame width, frame height and frames per second (fps) of the video source. The application counts the number of people and generates motion heatmap.

    ![Architectural diagram](./docs/images/arch_diagram.png)

-  People counter: The OpenCV **HOG Descriptor** detects the people in the frame and bounding boxes are drawn on the people detected.

- Motion Heatmap generation: An accumulated frame is used, on which every frame is added after preprocessing. This accumulated frame is used to generate the motion heatmap using [applyColorMap](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d3/d50/group__imgproc__colormap.html#gadf478a5e5ff49d8aa24e726ea6f65d15). The original frame and heatmap frame are merged using [addWeighted](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/core/adding_images/adding_images.html), to visualize the movement patterns over time.

-  The heatmap frame and people counter frame are merged using [addWeighted](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/core/adding_images/adding_images.html) and this merged frame is saved locally at regular intervals. The output is present in the *build* directory of the project directory.

-  The application also uploads the results to the Microsoft Azure cloud at regular intervals, if a Microsoft Azure storage name and key are provided.

## Setup
### Get the code
Clone the reference implementation<br>
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/store-aisle-monitor-cpp.git
```

### Install OpenVINO

Refer to [Install Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for Linux*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/OpenVINO-Install-Linux) to learn how to install and configure the toolkit.

### Install Intel® System Studio 2019

1. Download [Intel® System Studio 2019](https://software.intel.com/en-us/system-studio/choose-download) and extract the downloaded zip file.
2. Open a new terminal and navigate to the directory where the contents are extracted in the previous step.
3. Run ./install.sh script and follow the instructions provided there to install Intel® System Studio 2019.

### Other dependencies

**Azure Storage Client Library**<br>

The [Azure Storage Client Library for C++](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-cpp) allows you to build applications against Microsoft Azure Storage. [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction) is Microsoft's cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios. Azure Storage offers a massively scalable object store for data objects, a file system service for the cloud, a messaging store for reliable messaging, and a NoSQL store.

### Install the dependencies
To download the sample video and install the dependencies of the application, run the below command in the `store-aisle-monitor-cpp` directory:
```
./setup.sh
```
### The config file
The _resources/config.json_ contains the path of video that will be used by the application as input.

For example:
   ```
   {
       "inputs": [
          {
              "video":"path_to_video/video1.mp4"
          }
       ]
   }
   ```

The `path/to/video` is the path to an input video file.

### Which Input Video to use

We recommend using [store-aisle-detection](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/blob/master/store-aisle-detection.mp4) video.
For example:
   ```
   {
       "inputs": [
          {
              "video":"sample-videos/store-aisle-detection.mp4
          }
       ]
   }
   ```
If the user wants to use any other video, it can be used by providing the path in the config.json file.

### Using the Camera instead of video
Replace `path/to/video` with the camera ID in the **config.json** file, where the ID is taken from the video device (the number **X** in /dev/video**X**).

On Ubuntu, to list all available video devices use the following command:

```
ls /dev/video*
```

For example, if the output of above command is __/dev/video0__, then config.json would be:

```
  {
     "inputs": [
        {
           "video":"0"
        }
     ]
  }
```
### Setup the environment

Configure the environment to use the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit one time per session by exporting environment variables:

```
source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh
```
**Note:** This command needs to be executed only once in the terminal where the application will be executed. If the terminal is closed, the command needs to be executed again.

### Build the application
To build, go to intruder-detector-cpp directory and run the following commands:

```
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Run the application
### Run the Application from the Terminal

To run the application, use the following command:
```
./store-aisle-monitor 
```

### (Optional) Saving snapshots to the Cloud

To upload the results to the cloud, the Microsoft Azure storage name and storage key are provided as the command line arguments. Use -n and -k options to specify Microsoft Azure storage name and storage key respectively.
```
./store-aisle-monitor -n <account_name> -k <account-key>
```
**Note:**<br>
* To obtain account name and account key from the Microsoft Azure portal, please refer: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-python#copy-your-credentials-from-the-azure-portal
